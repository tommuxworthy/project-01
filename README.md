# project-01
This was my first project of the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course (Week 4).

Javascript Snake Game
-
- This project is a browser game of Snake built with Vanilla Javascript.

Built With
- 
1. HTML 5
        - audio
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. GitHub

Deployment
- 
- The game is deployed on GitHub Pages and it can be found here: 

Getting Started
- 
In GitHub, use the clone button to download the game source code. Then, open the index.html file in your browser and the game should start - if not check console for any issues. The images used in this game are stored in the images folder and are all png files.


Game Architecture
- 
- Snake is a game where the player attempts to create the longest snake possible by eating the most amount of apples. 
- The player can choose to move the snake in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
- Snake is a single player game.
- The snake is be able to eat food to grow bigger.
- Each apple is worth one point, which is added to the total.
- The game ends when the snake hits the wall or itself.
- There is a 'crunch' sound when the snake eats an apple and a 'gong' sounds when the game ends.
- The snake speeds up as it eats more.
- The game has a responsive design.
- The score is displayed during and after each game.
- If the snake is moving left it cannot immediately move right and vice-versa.
- If the snake is moving up it cannot immediately move down and vice-versa.


Challenges and future improvement
-
- The main challenge of this project was to create sound game-logic that would ensure the incremental growth of the snake. 
- I would like to add more features to this game. For example, I would like to have different fruits with different points for each.
- I would like to add a scoreboard with names of each player.
- I would also like to introduce different difficulty modes.

Features
What makes your project stand out?

Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out how your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

Installation
Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running.

API Reference
Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

Tests
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

How to use?
- Snake is a simple game that uses four buttons (up, down, left, right). To move the snake press one of the four buttons to navigate towards the apple. Each apple you eat adds one point to your score and a new apple will be randomly generated. The game ends if the snake hits the perimeter of the grid or itself. 

Contribute
- Use the clone button to download the game source code. Open the index.html file in your browser and the game should start, if not check console for any issues. The images used in this game are stored in the images folder and are all png files.
