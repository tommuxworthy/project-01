How to use?
- Snake is a simple game that uses four buttons (up, down, left, right). To move the snake press one of the four buttons to navigate towards the apple. Each apple you eat adds one point to your score and a new apple will be randomly generated. The game ends if the snake hits the perimeter of the grid or itself.
