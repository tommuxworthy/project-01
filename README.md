Game Architecture
- 
- Snake is a game where the player attempts to create the longest snake possible by eating the most amount of apples. 
- The player can choose to move the snake in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
- Snake is a single player game.
- The snake is be able to eat food to grow bigger.
- Each apple is worth one point, which is added to the total.
- The game ends when the snake hits the wall or itself.
- There is a 'crunch' sound when the snake eats an apple and a 'gong' sounds when the game ends.
- The snake speeds up as it eats more.
- The game has a responsive design.
- The score is displayed during and after each game.
- If the snake is moving left it cannot immediately move right and vice-versa.
- If the snake is moving up it cannot immediately move down and vice-versa.

Challenges and future improvement
-
- The main challenge of this project was to create sound game-logic that would ensure the incremental growth of the snake. 
- I would like to add more features to this game. For example, I would like to have different fruits with different points for each.
- I would like to add a scoreboard with names of each player.
- I would also like to introduce different difficulty modes.
